# Propaganda! A declarative programming model in Clojure

I had the pleasure of giving a talk about propagators at the Clojurians
meetup hosted by Bruce Durling and Skillsmatter March 10, 2014. Amidst
my ramblings, I went through quite a lot of examples, which I promised
would be made available. This repository contains not only those
examples, but also the slides from the presentation. Boot up your REPL,
and step through the `src/demo.clj` file at your leisure. Enjoy!

If you want to learn more about propagators, there is a wealth of links
on the main propaganda github repo
[found here](http://github.com/tgk/propaganda). There is also a couple
of posts about adding sets in these blog posts:
